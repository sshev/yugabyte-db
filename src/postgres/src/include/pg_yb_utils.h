 * date. In any other case, we will end up doing a cache refresh anyway.
 * (I.e. cache data is only valid if the version below matches with master's
 * version, otherwise all bets are off and we need to refresh.)
 *
 * So we should handle cases like:
 * 1. yb_catalog_cache_version being behind the actual data in the caches.
 * 2. Data in the caches spanning multiple version (because catalog was updated
 *    during a cache refresh).
 * As long as the invariant above is not violated we should (at most) end up
